This C program solves quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. It calculates the discriminant to determine the nature of the solutions and displays them accordingly:

Two real and distinct solutions if Δ>0

One real solution if Δ=0

No real solutions if Δ<0

Features
User-friendly interface to input coefficients 
a, 𝑏 and 𝑐
Calculates and displays solutions up to two decimal places
Handles cases with no real solutions
